# GitStream

A react app that usses the git hub api to display user data. Gitstream allows users to create an account on the platform. Users are able to view and follow other users. Once you are following a user they will appear in the following tab and the users can view all their repos.

### Installation

How to run Gitstream:

```
npm install
npm run start
navigate to {your local host}/login
```

**side note**
When following or unfollowing a user you do it in the dev tab. The text doesn't update but just check if a user is being follewed in the following tab. (This will be fixed)
